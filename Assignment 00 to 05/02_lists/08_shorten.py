# Fill out the function shorten(lst) which removes elements from the end of lst, which is a list, and prints each item it removes until lst is MAX_LENGTH items long. If lst is already shorter than MAX_LENGTH you should leave it unchanged. We've written a main() function for you which gets a list and passes it into your function once you run the program. For the autograder to pass you will need MAX_LENGTH to be 3, but feel free to change it around to test your program.
MAX_LENGTH = 3
def shorten(lst):
    while len(lst) > MAX_LENGTH:
        removed_elements = lst.pop()
        print(removed_elements ,end="")
def main():
    my_list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    shorten(my_list)
if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
